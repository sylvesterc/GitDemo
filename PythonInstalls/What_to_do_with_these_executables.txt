These executables contain common Python modules for scientific data analysis and
visualization.

All the packages are located in: 

\\ozma\support\software\Python2.6

This document includes instructions for installating these modules and links to 
background information.  Please install all these packages by copying them locally,
and running them as administrator. 

They are listed in the order in which you should install them.

1a) THIS IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED:  PyScripter (http://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/)- a
very nice open-source Python IDE; 

- or -

1b) Console (http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/) - a better windows 
command prompt/window; copy \\ozma\support\software\Python2.6\Console-2.00b147-
Beta_32bit\Console2 to your local C: drive.

2) Ipython (http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/) - an interactive Python 
programming/data exploration environment that runs in Python IDE. 
Copy the executable to your Desktop and then run the executable,
ipython-0.10.2.win32-setup.exe as adiminstrator.  During setup, make sure it locates the 
info for your Python 2.6 installation in the ArcGIS installation directory.

3) Pyreadline (http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/PyReadline/Intro) - enables very 
handy tab completion, "arrowing up" through past commands, etc. in the 
Python IDE.  Run the executable pyreadline-1.5-win32-
setup.exe.  During setup, make sure it locates the info for your Python 2.6 
installation in the ArcGIS installation directory.

* If it is not there already, add the Python path to your Path environment 
variable (System variable).  The path should be C:\Python26\ArcGIS10.0.  

* If you'll use the Console window, make a shortcut to it on your desktop, otherwise
skip to step 4.  Edit the Console shortcut properties such that Ipython is automatically
loaded by Console.  Set the Target: to 

C:\Console2\Console.exe -r "/k python.exe 
c:\python26\ArcGIS10.0\scripts\ipython.py -p sh"

Then test your setup by opening the Console shortcut.  You should see a message 
about successful installation and hitting enter to start Python.  Hit enter.  
At the command prompt type "import arcpy" (don't type the "").  Then type 
"arcpy." And a list of items should print to the screen.  That means 1) the 
python environment is successfully loaded and 2) your ever important tab-
completion is working!

The next 3 packages work together:

4) Numpy 1.6 (http://numpy.scipy.org/) - modules for scientific computing in 
Python (Matlab-ish, better suited for some things but not necessarily 
everything, provides for use of arrays and matrix math).  Run the executable 
numpy-1.6.0b2-win32-superpack-python2.6.exe.

5) Scipy (http://www.scipy.org/) - modules for more scientific computing 
(advanced math, signal processings, statistics, etc.).  Run the executable scipy-
scipy-0.11.0rc1-win32-superpack-python2.6.exe.

6) Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) - modules for data 
visualization/exploration and publication quality graphics.  Run the 
executable matplotlib-1.1.1.win32-py2.6.exe.


Default installation directory for Python modules:
C:\Python 26\ArcGIS10.0\Lib\site-packages

Uninstalling Matplotlib:
- In python, type
import matplotlib as mpl  <enter>
myDir = mpl.get_configdir() <enter>
myDir <enter>
- In Win Explorer, browse to location specified in myDir and
delete what you see there
- In Add/Remove Programs, select matplotlib and unstall it
